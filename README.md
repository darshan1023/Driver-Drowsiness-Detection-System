This Project helps in preventing the car accidents by alerting the drivers who falls asleep when driving the vehicle.The Webcam is mounted on the car such that the face of the driver is clearly captured by the webcam. The Webcam captures the images of face & compares it with the images of eyes from the dataset.

The dataset comprises of different blinking images of eyes at the different positions.Data Preparation has been updated with train and test folder split automation for training the model.

The trained model predicts & gives the result whether the eyes of the driver are closed or opened. If the result produced by the trained model is closed, then the alarm sound is automatically played to alert the driver to wake him up.
